Description: The National Cancer Database is a a joint project of the Commission on Cancer (CoC) of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. The NCDB was established in 1989 as a hospital-based registry containing detailed information on patient demographics, diagnostic approaches, treatment modalities, and vital status at follow-up. The database represents approximately 72% of all cancer cases and 84.3% of all cases involving the nose, nasal cavity, and middle ear in the United States with contributions from over 1500 national Commission on Cancer-accredited programs.
    This package uses values contained in the PUF data dictionary file and recodes the variables as factors (when indicated) with appropriate labels.
